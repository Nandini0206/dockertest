# RANsquawk Interview Tech Test - Docker
## Synopsis
This repository is a simple program to scrape the [BBC sports website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport) for articles. In it's current state it gets the top row of articles but needs to organise the data for presentation. The program isn't interacted with, it is just meant to get the data, organise it and present it

## Requirements
For this test you need to dockerise this ruby application then find and then you'll need to finish up the code - search the project for #TODO.
If you're unfamiliar with docker then it's worth reading the getting started section of the website [here](https://docs.docker.com/)
It's up to you if you want to just create a docker image or use a docker-compose file.

## If you're stuck? Communicate!
Don't feel like you have to complete this whole thing on your own, we want to know at what your strengths and weaknesses are, and more importantly how you communicate them. So don't be afraid to reach out when you need some guidance.
